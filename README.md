# Shopping Cart Project – JavaScript in Practice
### This project represents a practical entry point into JavaScript, focusing on how the language can be used to add real functionality and interactivity to a front-end application.
### The goal of the project is to simulate a shopping cart for a fictional figure store, where users can add products, remove items, and see the total price update dynamically.

## How Does the Project Work?
### The website allows users to interact with a product list and a shopping cart system.
### With JavaScript, the application:
#### - Adds selected products to the cart.
#### - Calculates the total price automatically.
#### - Updates quantities and values in real time.
#### - Handles basic cart logic to simulate a real e-commerce experience.

### This project shows how small JavaScript features can significantly improve user experience and make a website feel more professional and functional.

## Technologies Used:
### This project was developed using the following web technologies:
#### HTML: Provides the structure for the store layout and cart section.
#### CSS: Responsible for styling, layout organization, and visual consistency.
#### JavaScript: Core of the project, handling cart logic, product summation, and user interaction.

# NOTES:
## This project was created for learning purposes, focusing on JavaScript fundamentals applied to real-world scenarios. It helped reinforce concepts such as variables, conditionals, functions, events, and DOM manipulation. The project demonstrates how JavaScript connects logic with the user interface in a clear and practical way.
